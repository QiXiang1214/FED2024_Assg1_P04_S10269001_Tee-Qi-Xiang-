Tee Qi Xiang’s FED Project: Pinkfish Music Festival Webpage

The Pinkfish Music Festival website is a dynamic, immersive experience designed to bring the excitement and energy of the festival right to your screen. More than just a source of information, it’s a digital gateway to a world where music, art, and community come together in vibrant harmony. From indie and electronic beats to hip-hop and experimental sounds, Pinkfish celebrates diversity, creativity, and the joy of live performance. The goal is to create a space where fans can connect with their favourite artists, explore event details, and feel the pulse of the festival before they even step foot on the grounds.
With a bright, playful design and intuitive navigation, the website captures the spirit of Pinkfish like bold, inclusive, and full of life. It invites users to dive into artist stories, discover what’s on the schedule, and even explore behind-the-scenes content that makes the festival special. Whether you’re a returning fan or attending for the first time, the Pinkfish website is your all-access pass to the heart of the festival, sparking excitement and anticipation for an unforgettable experience.

My Design Process
The Pinkfish Music Festival website is designed for anyone who loves music, live events, and the feeling of being part of something exciting. Whether you’re a first-time attendee looking for the lineup or a loyal fan wanting behind-the-scenes updates, this site is built to make your experience smooth, fun, and engaging. It’s more than a festival that you think, it’s a vibrant community, and the website brings that energy to life.
For music lovers and live event enthusiasts, we focused on making it easy to find what you need while building excitement for the festival. From exploring past highlights to planning for upcoming shows, the site offers everything you need to feel connected. It’s all about creating a space where users can discover, plan, and get inspired.
For newcomers, there’s an introduction page called “What The Fish,” where they can learn more about what we do. At the bottom of the page, users will find app icons that link to social media posts and videos, offering even more ways to engage. Lastly, if users have any feedback, they can visit the “Contact Us” page to share their thoughts, and we’ll use it to make the experience even better.
